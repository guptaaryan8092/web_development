Write a PHP code for login_submit.php that will be executed on submitting the login form (login_form.php) that you created in the previous topic as a part of an exercise. The code should check if the email and password entered in the form are exactly the same as that stored in the database. If it does not match, it should say ‘Login Failed’. And, if it matches, it should print "Hello Name" (name as stored in the database).
